<h1>Wheelchair control using the eyes</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
My team and I developed the electronics to acquire the biosignals around the eyes and with the use of analog circuits control the motor of a prototype of a wheelchair. The highlight about this project is that all of it did not use any programming, everything was achieved using electronics components.
